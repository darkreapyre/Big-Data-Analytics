    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this case study, we will explore how to tackle Kaggle Titanic competition using Python and Machine Learning. When the Titanic sank, $1502$ of the $2224$ passengers and crew were killed. One of the main reasons for this high level of casualties was the lack of lifeboats on this self-proclaimed __\"unsinkable\"__ ship. In this tutorial, we will learn how to apply machine learning techniques to predict a passenger's chance of surviving using Python.\n",

    "# Getting Data with Pandas\n",
    "We start with loading in the training and testing set into your Python environment. We will use the [training set](http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/train.csv) to build our model, and the [test set](http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/test.csv) to validate it. The first step is to load this data with the `read_csv()` method from the Pandas library."

This means that no limit on the depth of the tree was set. This is not necessary a good thing, as we are likely overfitting. This means that while our model describes the training data extremely well, it doesn't generalize to new data, which is frankly the point of prediction. \n",

    "One solution to address this is to make  a less complex model. In `DecisionTreeRegressor`, the depth of the model is defined by two parameters:\n",
    "- The `max_depth` parameter determines when the splitting up of the decision tree stops.\n",
    "- The `min_samples_split` parameter monitors the amount of observations in a bucket. If a certain threshold is not reached (e.g minimum 10 passengers) no further splitting can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "By limiting the complexity of the decision tree we can increase its generality and thus its usefulness for better prediction. To test this theory we now include the Siblings or Spouses Aboard (`SibSp`), Parents/Children Aboard (`Parch`), and `Embarked` features in a new set of features and fit a  second tree (`my_tree_two`) with the new features, and control for the model compelexity by toggling the `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` arguments."

Family size is determined by the variables `SibSp` and `Parch`, which indicate the number of family members a certain passenger is traveling with.

    "A detailed study of Random Forests is outside the scope of this tutorial. However, since it's an often used machine learning technique, we introduce a general overview in Python. The Random Forest technique handles the overfitting problem we saw with decision trees. It grows multiple (very deep) classification trees using the training set. At the time of prediction, each tree is used to come up with a prediction and every outcome is counted as a vote. For example, if we have trained $3$ trees with $2$ saying a passenger in the test set will survive and $1$ says he will not, the passenger will be classified as a survivor. This approach of overtraining trees, but having the majority's vote count as the actual classification decision, avoids overfitting.\n",

    "Recall that in the when using the Decision Tree models, we looked at the `.feature_importances_` attribute to see how each of the feature influenced the decision trees.  We can request the same attribute from the random forest as well and interpret the relevance of the included variables. Since the Random Forest aleviates the overfitting problem, it would be a good exercise to compare it to the Decision Tree model in some quick and easy way. For this, we can use the `.score()` method, which takes the features data and the target vector and computes mean accuracy of the model."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Based on our findings from the various models that have been run, we can determine which feature was of most importance, and for which model.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The most important feature was \"Sex\", but it was more significant for \"my_tree_two\" Decision Tree.__\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ensemble Methods\n",
    "In an prediction task, it is important try and test multiple algorithms to find the best possible fit. In most cases it is not necessary or possible to test every single algorithm type against the data, a fare assesment may suffice, but it is a good practice to at least try achieve a better fit. That is why we introduced a different Machine Learning algorithm to the `DecisionTreeClassifier()` we were currently using. What we did in essence is introduce an Ensemble Method. The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability or robustness over a single estimator. In our case, we used the `RandomForestClassifier()` which built several (very deep) classification trees that when used for prediction, each tree is used to come up with a prediction and every outcome is counted as a vote. This is an example of an __averaging methods__. Here, the driving principle is to build several estimators independently and then to average their predictions. On average, the combined estimator is usually better than any of the single base estimator because its variance is reduced. This is evedent when comparing the score from both models above.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest issues with ensemble Methods is that they can be computationally exhaustive. The alternative is manually trying every possible variable combinations (since there is no easy way to know which parameters work best, other than trying out many different combinations) or parameter combinations (hyperparameters) to get the best model fit. Fortunately, the `scikit-learn` package includes the `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` functions wich allows for the evaluation of each parameter setting independently, in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The down-side to this is the fact that this is not scalable. The models above are executed on data in Pandas DataFrames. These DataFrames are memory resident, so unless the machine executing the models has sufficient memory or the data sets are small enough, the `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` functions may not be helpful. Fortunately the team at Databrix has released the [`spark-sklearn`](http://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-sklearn) package to allow us to execute these funcitons over a Spark cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example is based on the  [Auto-scaling scikit-learn with Spark](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/02/08/auto-scaling-scikit-learn-with-spark.html) example, but has been adapted to our Titanic example. The objective is to populate a \"grid\" of various model parameters and have `GridSearchCV` execute each set of parameters to determine the best score. The goal here is not necessarily to find a model with a better score but to illustrate the time it takes to search through the various model parameters to find the best one. The example has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `GridSearchCV` library from `scikit-learn`.\n",
    "2. Create the function to report the top $3$ models, courtesy of [Databrix](http://go.databricks.com/hubfs/notebooks/Samples/Miscellaneous/blog_post_cv.html).\n",
    "3. Create the \"grid\" of parameters combnations to execute. Thjis is loosley based on the Databrix example.\n",
    "4. Fit the model with the \"grid\"of parameters."
